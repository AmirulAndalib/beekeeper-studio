# 4.1 - Spreadsheet mode, pop-out editors, Wayland support, and more

This was intended to be a small point release after the release of 4.0. I guess things got a little out of hand :-).

## Headline Features

### Spreadsheet style table interactions!

You can do a bunch of stuff with tables that 'just makes sense' now including:
- Selecting rows / columns
- Selecting a range of cells
- Copying data from the selected cells/columns/rows
- Pasting data into a table across multiple cells
- Navigating with the keyboard
