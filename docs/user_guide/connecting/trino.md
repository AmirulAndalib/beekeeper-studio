# Trino Support

Check back frequently as we are making continual updates to our Trino support.

Super excited to have Trino support here for you all. Please bear in mind that Trino is only in the early stages of implementation, but we wanted to release it to y'all for testing.

Support has been limited to basically a "read only" state since any form of writing should be done in the confines of the database itself.

## Supported Features

- Table data view
- Table data sorting, filtering
- Table structure view
- Export query results as JSON, CSV, or Markdown

## Still TBD

- SSH tunneling
