title: Saving Queries
summary: "Save your queries and import .sql files in Saved Queries"
---

Sometimes we have queries that we use repetitively. To avoid losing our SQL queries, we can save them to a file, or use the Saved Queries panel.

## Save a query

You can save a query by pressing `Ctrl+S` or clicking the `Save` button at the bottom right of the Query Editor.

After that, you can type the name of the query (you can rename it later), and then click `Save`.

## Use the saved queries

You can open the Saved Queries panel to see all your saved queries by clicking the Saved Queries icon at the sidebar. After that, you can open the query by double clicking it.

## Import SQL files

To import query files to Saved Queries, you can click the import button, and then click `Import .sql files`. From here, you can import multiple files of `.sql` or any text file format. This will make a copy of your file to your Saved Queries. Any changes from the original files will not be reflected in Beekeepe Studio.

## Where does Beekeeper Studio save my SQL Queries?

When you save SQL queries in Beekeeper Studio they are persisted to a SQLite database in your local configuration directory. Please see [Data Storage Location](/support/data-location) for more details.
